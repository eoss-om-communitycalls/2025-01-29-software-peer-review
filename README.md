Peer review is a helpful tool for ensuring high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software. In this document, we share insights discussed in the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative’s Essential Open Source Software program community call held on January 29, 2025, featuring rOpenSci’s Noam Ross. 

We encourage suggestions and contributions to expand the scope of issues that open source project leaders should consider when managing a project, as well as resources that would be helpful to leaders and their projects.
